This New Testament parable of the lost sheep is written in playful rhythm and rhyme for the youngest readers. The shepherd has one hundred sheep, but one wanders off. The shepherd searches and searches, knowing that each and every one of his sheep is important and worthy of his care. He rejoices upon finding his one lost sheep.
