Using metaphors, a little girl tells her mommy how special she is through all the seasons of the year. (A card is included inside the book to give a mommy.)

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
Mommy is a buried treasure <br />
in the sand and sun. <br />
I cover her…discover her! <br />
What silly summer fun!
<br /><br />
Mommy is an angel, <br />
with snow-white, whisper wings, <br />
who glides with me down slippery slopes <br />
and laughs and plays and sings.
</p2></blockquote>

"This rhyming celebration of mother/daughter love describes all the fun the two have together…"  
_Kirkus_

"…The rhyming text is perfect, the colorful illustrations not only meet the text but flow like a mind merge between author and illustrator…This is not a book any mother with a daughter should miss."  
_Children's Literature_
