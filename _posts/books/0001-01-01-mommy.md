Using metaphors, a little girl tells her mommy how special she is through all the seasons of the year. (A card is included inside the book to give a mommy.)

> _Mommy is a buried treasure  
> in the sand and sun.  
> I cover her…discover her!  
> What silly summer fun!_

> _Mommy is an angel,  
> with snow-white, whisper wings,  
> who glides with me down slippery slopes  
> and laughs and plays and sings._

"This rhyming celebration of mother/daughter love describes all the fun the two have together…"  
_Kirkus_

"…The rhyming text is perfect, the colorful illustrations not only meet the text but flow like a mind merge between author and illustrator…This is not a book any mother with a daughter should miss."  
_Children's Literature_
