Jonah disobeys God by not going to Ninevah and soon finds himself on a boat in the middle of a powerful storm. Knowing he has caused the storm, Jonah tells the mariners to throw him overboard. Once they do, Jonah is swallowed by a great fish. While stuck inside the belly of the fish for three long days, Jonah prays. Finally the fish spits him out upon land. Jonah, learning his lesson, decides to obey God. Using rhythm and rhyme, this is a lyrical retelling of the Old Testament story of Jonah for young readers.
