Using metaphors, a little boy tells his daddy how special he is through all the seasons of the year. (A card is included inside the book to give a daddy.)

> _Daddy is my pillow  
> where I rest my sleepy head.  
> When camping far beneath the stars,  
> he's better than a bed._

> _Daddy is the rushing wind  
> that makes my kite take wing  
> and dip and dive, as if alive,  
> a-dancing on a string._

"Any man can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a daddy. Here, Greene shows a man spending time with his son through all four seasons. They camp, rake leaves, walk in the snow, and fly kites. Although the months are not named, there is a spread for each one…the poetry flows naturally…Both the text and illustrations give a sense of cheerfulness and warmth…"
