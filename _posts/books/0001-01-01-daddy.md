Using metaphors, a little boy tells his daddy how special he is through all the seasons of the year. (A card is included inside the book to give a daddy.)

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
Daddy is my pillow <br />
where I rest my sleepy head. <br />
When camping far beneath the stars, <br />
he's better than a bed.
<br /><br />
Daddy is the rushing wind <br />
that makes my kite take wing <br />
and dip and dive, as if alive, <br />
a-dancing on a string.
</p2></blockquote>

"Any man can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a daddy. Here, Greene shows a man spending time with his son through all four seasons. They camp, rake leaves, walk in the snow, and fly kites. Although the months are not named, there is a spread for each one…the poetry flows naturally…Both the text and illustrations give a sense of cheerfulness and warmth…"
