In this warm-hearted and lyrical text, a little boy, full of wonder, asks his mama who makes a tiny seed, a curled-up kitten, the salty sea, and more.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
Mama, look! <br />
A tiny sprout! <br />
Who made this sprig <br />
of spring pop out?
<br /><br />
He who knows <br />
our every need. <br />
Only God <br />
can make a seed.
</p2></blockquote>
