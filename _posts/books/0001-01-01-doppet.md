Dr. Kate is the kindest, most caring doctor there is. She's a pediatrician whom everyone in the town of Doppet, grown-ups and children alike, adore. She treats the children with much tenderness. Plus, she hands out lollipops and stickers and even has a treasure chest. But what happens when Dr. Kate gets sick?!

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
In the town of Doppet <br />
when morning clocks chime eight, <br />
who comes to care for boys and girls? <br />
Tiny Dr. Kate…
<br /><br />
First she scrubs and scrubs her hands <br />
with lots of bubbly soap. <br />
She listens to th-thumping hearts <br />
with her stethoscope…
<br /><br />
The children all love Dr. Kate. <br />
The grown-ups love her, too. <br />
Without their caring Dr. Kate, <br />
what would Doppet do?
