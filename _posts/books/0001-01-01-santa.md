Uh-oh! Santa's stuck in the chimney on Christmas Eve from eating too many sweets. Who will help him out? All the animals—the dog, the reindeer, the mother cat and her kittens, and a tiny mouse—push and pull, but to no avail. "No-o-o-o-o luck—Santa's stuck!" until…

"One snack too many lands Santa in a tight spot—literally. During his appointed gift-giving rounds on Christmas Eve, Santa can't resist nibbling the numerous treats and sweets the children have out for him. But the goodies take a toll on his waistline, leaving jolly St. Nick wedged, unable to whisk himself back up the chimney. Luckily he receives a helping paw (and a few hooves). This playful package of rhyming verse and humorous acrylic-and-colored-pencil vignettes will likely get the giggles going."
