A joyous celebration where all living things praise their creator.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
All that breathe, the seasons round, <br />
the stars and Moon, Sun's rays, <br />
rivers, trees, and mountains <br />
all sing a song of praise.
</p2></blockquote>

"With exuberant jewel-toned illustrations…and a bouncy rhyming text, Greene and Broxon interpret Psalms 148 and 150, in which all living creation praises God. Playful words and phrasing add to the fun for younger readers in such verse as 'Barn doves coo as milk cows moo / in beastly, joyful song. / Horses n-ei-eigh while donkeys br-a-ay / as piglets join along. Oink!' The combination of cheery animals and vibrant naturescapes…convey the joyous energy of these much-loved biblical passages…"
