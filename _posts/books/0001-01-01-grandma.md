"…A loving, deeply satisfying story that lights up the path toward sweet dreams. Ahhh…"  
_\*Starred review, Booklist_

"…sweetly rendered…haiku-like…The fondness the two share (grandmother and child)…bathes both text and illustrations in 'golden light'…"  
_Publishers Weekly_

"A grandma and her grandchild spend a day together in this bright, warm, and cheerful picture book. Greene's bouncy verse…swings readers along through a variety of experiences: berry picking, enjoying a picnic lunch, gardening, firefly counting, and sharing a bedtime story…delightful combination of text and pictures…"
