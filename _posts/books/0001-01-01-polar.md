Yo-Ho-Ho! Polar bear pirates are rough-tough bears on the Arctic Sea. They're on a search for treasure. When they finally find it—uh, oh!—they not only lose their manners, but the treasure too—to puffin pirates! Will those big, bad bears ever learn to behave? A fun book for any pirate lover!

Though a playful, make-believe story, lots of fascinating facts about real polar bears are included at the end of the book.

> _On Arctic seas, there sails a ship  
> of big, bad bears upon a trip.  
> They steer through waves of ice and snow.  
> They're polar bear pirates! Yo-Ho-Ho!..._

> _From up, up high, a mate spies land.  
> "Dock the ship!" comes the command.  
> Polar bear pirates disembark.  
> Polar bear pirates hunt for the mark._

> _X is the spot on the treasure map.  
> "Aye!" they yell, then CHOP-CHOP-TAP!_
