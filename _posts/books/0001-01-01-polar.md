Yo-Ho-Ho! Polar bear pirates are rough-tough bears on the Arctic Sea. They're on a search for treasure. When they finally find it—uh, oh!—they not only lose their manners, but the treasure too—to puffin pirates! Will those big, bad bears ever learn to behave? A fun book for any pirate lover!

Though a playful, make-believe story, lots of fascinating facts about real polar bears are included at the end of the book.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
On Arctic seas, there sails a ship <br />
of big, bad bears upon a trip. <br />
They steer through waves of ice and snow. <br />
They're polar bear pirates! Yo-Ho-Ho!...
<br /><br />
From up, up high, a mate spies land. <br />
"Dock the ship!" comes the command. <br />
Polar bear pirates disembark. <br />
Polar bear pirates hunt for the mark.
<br /><br />
X is the spot on the treasure map. <br />
"Aye!" they yell, then CHOP-CHOP-TAP!
