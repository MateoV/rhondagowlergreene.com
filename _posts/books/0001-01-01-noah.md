The familiar Old Testament story of Noah and the ark is retold in warm and playful rhyme. The animals creep and crawl and hop and fly and stomp and tromp and slither, two by two, into that mighty ark.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
Then, he called the creatures <br />
two by two— <br />
the elephant and kangaroo,
<br /><br />
the crocodile, <br />
the chimpanzee, <br />
the busy buzzing bumblebee…
<br /><br />
While up above <br />
that giant ark, <br />
the sky was growing <br />
very dark…
</p2></blockquote>

"…littlest readers will find here a fun introduction to the basic premise of Noah's steadfast faith."  
_Publishers Weekly_

"…This rhymed version scans well, which encourages reading aloud…"
