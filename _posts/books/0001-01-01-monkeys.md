No matter the weather, or the distance, mail monkeys are determined to deliver the mail. Not only do they brave the usual rainy, snowy, and blustery days, but these hard-working monkeys also travel far distances—even undersea and to outer space! This rhythmic romp with its repeating stanza and fun rhymes is especially good for beginning readers.

> _A far destination?  
> They know what to do.  
> Their motto is always—  
> the mail must go through!_
