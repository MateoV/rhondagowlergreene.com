No matter the weather, or the distance, mail monkeys are determined to deliver the mail. Not only do they brave the usual rainy, snowy, and blustery days, but these hard-working monkeys also travel far distances—even undersea and to outer space! This rhythmic romp with its repeating stanza and fun rhymes is especially good for beginning readers.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
In rain, sleet, or snow, <br />
in heat, wind, or hail, <br />
monkeys delight <br />
in delivering mail
<br /><br />
A far destination? <br />
They know what to do. <br />
Their motto is always— <br />
the mail must go through!
