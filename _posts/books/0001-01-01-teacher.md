What happens when everything goes wrong at school? How is a teacher to cope?! A funny, cumulative text in the "House That Jack Built" style and hilarious artwork capture just that kind of chaotic day.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
This is the teacher all ready for school. <br />
These are the students who rush through the door, <br />
who drop sacks of lunches that smash! on the floor <br />
and topple the teacher all ready for school.
</p2></blockquote>

"Every teacher knows that some days, no matter how ready for school they are in the morning, they'll leave fit only for bed. In this story…everything that can go wrong does all in one day. Ants and boas and hamsters escape. Bees and baseballs and rain intrude. Floods flow from water fountains and cupcakes fly. A tooth is lost and so is one student's lunch. Is it any wonder that the teacher of the title can only collapse with her cat when she gets home? Greene's cause-and-effect public service announcement for Murphy's Law and Lester's wacky, inspired illustrations are perfect together…"
