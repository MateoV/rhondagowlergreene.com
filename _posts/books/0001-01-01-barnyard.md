"In prose reminiscent of the 'Old MacDonald' song, Greene develops an amusing story. The
farm animals catch the flu and their usual 'Buzz, buzz/Mew, mew/Cock-a-doodle-doo/Oink,
oink/Baa, baa/Moo, moo, moo' become 'Buzz, 'CHOO!/Mew, SNIFF!/Cock-a-SQUAWK!-le-
doo/Oink, SQUEAL/Baa, SNORT!/Moo, A-H-H-H-H-CHOO!' All ends happily when Farmer
cooks up and feeds them batches of healthy soup until their voices return and the familiar,
noisy farm life continues…Very young children will respond to the rhythm and rhyme…Older
preschoolers will giggle at the altered sounds and be reassured by the messages of love and
caring. A storytime winner."
_\*Starred review, School Library Journal_

"Greene's funny, rhyming text…will have kids vocalizing right along in no time…"
