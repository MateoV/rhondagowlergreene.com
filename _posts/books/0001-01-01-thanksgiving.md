<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
This is the very first Thanksgiving Day. <br />
This is the food, gathered and blessed, <br />
the corn and sweet berries, the wild turkey dressed <br />
shared on the very first Thanksgiving Day.
</p2></blockquote>

"…Greene succinctly describes the first feast and traces the Pilgrims' roots back to England. Gaber contributes breathtaking paintings…Her illustration of the Mayflower, seen as a tiny ship against a vast sea nearly indistinguishable from the sky, alone testifies to the Pilgrims' courageous journey."  
_Publishers Weekly_

"…a delightful, cumulative tale…Beautifully detailed acrylic paintings…"  
_The Topeka Capital Journal_
