> the corn and sweet berries, the wild turkey dressed  
> shared on the very first Thanksgiving Day._

"…Greene succinctly describes the first feast and traces the Pilgrims' roots back to England. Gaber contributes breathtaking paintings…Her illustration of the Mayflower, seen as a tiny ship against a vast sea nearly indistinguishable from the sky, alone testifies to the Pilgrims' courageous journey."  
_Publishers Weekly_

"…a delightful, cumulative tale…Beautifully detailed acrylic paintings…"
