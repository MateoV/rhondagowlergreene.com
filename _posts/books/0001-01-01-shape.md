A whimsical book about shapes. Playful poems and illustrations will spark children's
imaginations to find shapes everywhere they look!

"In this well-conceived, bouncy and colorful primer, Greene builds up various geometric figures from a line, the simplest element of every shape: 'A line is thin. A line is narrow—/curved like a worm, straight as an arrow.' Each spread acquaints readers with a single shape…Like concrete poetry, each verse takes on the shape it describes…In this clever and fun introduction to the assorted shapes, Greene and Kaczman collaborate effectively…through bouncy rhyme, familiar examples and clean-edged artwork."
_\*Starred review, Publishers Weekly_

"Ten shapes are presented in picture and verse. Along with the familiar circle, square, triangle, diamond, rectangle, octagon, and oval are the less frequent star, heart, and crescent…A fine addition to units on shapes and a perky read-aloud."
