> _Little Tree Frog woke that morning in May  
> and readied himself for Jamboree Day.  
> Then he hip-hop-hurried round far and near  
> to tell everyone the day was here._

> _'Now scrub your necks and shine your shoes  
> and call your cousins and spread the news!'_

"A bright green frog with a…megaphone stands in front of his house in a lush jungle setting, then hops from place to place to tell the other animals that it is Jamboree Day. In bouncing, hand-clapping, toe-tapping rhyme, Frog exhorts the animals to 'spread the news!' From crocodiles to cuckoos, they dance, march, fly, and row to the jamboree. There are balloons, a train ride, stage acts, and a limbo game and wild dancing well in to the night, and then all go home until next year…this is fun for storytime or one-on-one and children will join in and ask for repeats."
