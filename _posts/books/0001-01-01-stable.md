The story of the nativity told in gentle cumulative rhyme for young children. It includes Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, the angel, even some kittens and mice that gazed upon baby Jesus that first Christmas night.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
This is the stable where Jesus was born. <br />
This is the cow in the sweet-smelling hay, <br />
the cat and her kittens and three mice at play, <br />
that lived in the stable where Jesus was born.

"Skillful use of words provides for a text that is beautifully simple and maintains a natural rhythm, perfect for reading aloud."  
_School Library Journal_

"…a charming introduction to the nativity story…The strength of the book is the repetition of the text, which never becomes sing-songy…The sweetest of the many warm and earthy paintings is at the center of the book. It shows the newborn Christ being admired by three little kittens…"  
_Booklist_

"A good addition to a family library."
