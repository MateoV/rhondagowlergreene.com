<p class="h1top">For writers</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/writers_typing.jpg">

I'm often asked advice on how to get published. It's not easy getting published (understatement), but it's not impossible either.

This is what I recommend—

<p class="h4">Read…read…read other children's books</p>

Especially ones released in the last few years. And notice who publishes them. I am a firm believer that other children's books are the best teachers of all. Too, they show you what your competition is, and there is plenty of it! "Study" the books. Ask—

> What makes this book so good?  
> Why do I think this book got published?  
> Does the book have fresh writing?  
> Great rhythm?  
> Wonderful plot?  
> Is the 1st sentence a "grabber"?  
> Does it have a unique main character?  
> Does it have a satisfying ending? etc.

Then try to incorporate some of the best elements of the books into your own writing.

How do you know what's been recently released?

Visit bookstores. Also, Publishers Weekly (PW) has special issues in Feb. & July that list all the new children's books being released that season. You can find these issues at some bookstores and libraries, or you can call PW at 1-800-278-2991 to order them.

<p class="h4">Write</p>

As with anything, "practice makes perfect."

[www.scbwi.org](http://www.scbwi.org) (Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators) This is a national organization devoted to helping children's writers and illustrators. It provides valuable writing, illustrating, and marketing information; helps you get in contact with other writers and illustrators; and keeps you informed of upcoming events, conferences, and contests. Also join your local chapter of SCBWI. (Look at the national site to find info on your local or regional chapter.)

<p class="h4">Buy <i>Children's Writer's and Illustrator's Market</i></p>

(comes out annually) This is a market guide that lists book and magazine publishers, their addresses, and needs. It also includes helpful articles on such things as how to prepare a manuscript and how illustrators should submit their work to editors. Contests, conferences, and an extensive list of helpful books and websites are included.

<p class="h4">Join a critique group</p>

A great way to find one is through joining your regional chapter of SCBWI. I think it's best to be in a group with people who write in the same genre you do, such as picture books or YA (young adult).
