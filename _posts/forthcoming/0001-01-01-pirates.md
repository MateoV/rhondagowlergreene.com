A book that's sure to get kids excited about reading! A hilarious tale about what happens when Pirate Pete and his parrot, Igor, storm into Seabreezy Library ready to dig up treasure. But they've met their match with feisty Library Lou and learn that maybe gold, hmm…isn't the best treasure after all.

<blockquote class="excerpt"><p2 class="excerpt">
At Seabreezy Library, things were just right. <br />
Booklovers were cozy. The sky was blue-bright <br />
when—Shiver me timbers!—through Seabreezy's door <br />
stormed Big Pirate Pete and his parrot, Igor!
<br /><br />
"WHAR BE THE TREAURE? 'X' MARKS THIS SPOT! <br />
WE'LL DIG UP THE LOOT AND STEAL ALL THAT YE'VE GOT!"
