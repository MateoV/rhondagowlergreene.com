#An interview with Rhonda...#

<p class="h2">What made you want to become a children's author?</p>  
I love books. And I love kids. Growing up, I dreamed of being a teacher, which I was out of college. When I had kids of my own, though, I quit teaching and was a stay-at-home mom. I read and read and read to my kids (sorry dirty dishes!). The more I read really delightful children's books, the more they made me want to write books like that. So after I tucked my kids into bed at night—I wrote.

<p class="h2">Was it hard to get published?</p>  
Very. These are my 220 rejections before I made my first sale. And I still get rejections. I think it takes a tremendous amount of the 3 P's to get published… Passion, Persistence, and Patience.

<p class="h2">Where do you get ideas for your stories?</p>  
For me, ideas come from anywhere and everywhere. They often pop! in my head when I least expect them. Sometimes when I'm actually trying to think up a new story idea, I can't think of a thing. I get most of my ideas when reading other children's books. My house is like a library—I own hundreds!

<p class="h2">Do you illustrate your stories?</p>  
No. I'm not even good at drawing stick figures. But—maybe I have some hidden illustrator genes in me because my youngest son, Brad, is a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/bio_brad_drawing.jpg">talented artist</a>! He has a degree in illustration.

<p class="h2">Do you pick who illustrates your books?</p>  
I usually have no say in who illustrates my manuscripts. The editor chooses. There have been a few exceptions. I must say, it's really fun to finally see my written words come to life through pictures. The illustrations are usually even better than what I imagined when writing the story!

<p class="h2">Are you represented by a literary agency?</p>  
I've been with Curtis Brown Ltd. since 1996. Marilyn E. Marlow was my first agent. I was honored that she took me on. She was a legend in her field. Sadly, Marilyn passed away in 2003. I'm honored now to be represented by the very talented Elizabeth Harding.

<p class="h2">Are you married?</p><p> 
Yes, over 35 years to this handsome guy.
<br /><br />
Gary's an international tax accountant. He loves playing with numbers while I love playing with words! Through the years, his business travels have taken him all over the world.
<br /><br />
I like the picture books about the alligators, Mr. and Mrs. Green(e), by Keith Baker. Here are two lines from <i>Meet Mr. and Mrs. Green(e)</i>...
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Life with Mrs. Green(e) was full of adventure.</i> (True!) <br />  
<i>Life with Mr. Green(e) was full of surprises.</i> (True!)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Gary and I have been to many wonderful places in the world and some remote ones (like far far farrrrr out in NW Ireland). And he's taken me up flying.

<p class="h2">Where do you live?</p>  
I live in the beautiful state of Michigan amidst quiet blue lakes and even quieter snowfalls.

<p class="h2">Where did you grow up?</p>  
Southern Illinois (Salem, Mt. Vernon, and Cahokia). The summer before my senior year in high school, my family moved to northern Kentucky. I did not want to move! Within a year though, there was a happy ending—I met Gary. A few years later, we packed up and moved to Michigan and it's been 'home sweet home' ever since.

<p class="h2">Where did you go to college?</p>  
Northern KY University for undergrad (B.A. in elementary and special education) <br />
Xavier University in Cincinnati for master's (in educational media)

<p class="h2">How do you pronounce Gowler?</p>  
rhymes with 'how-ler' (no "r" after the "G," though people often slip one in there!)

<p class="h2">How many kids do you have?</p>  
Four terrific kids. Though they're grown now, they are still a huge part of my life. I'm so proud of them!

<p class="h2">What are your hobbies?</p>  
I love to read. And I love to travel. I've gotten to visit Europe several times. How lucky is that!

Too, I collect reading figurines. 179 at last count.

And I play the piano. I minored in music/piano in college and often think my music background influences the way I love to write with rhythm and rhyme.
