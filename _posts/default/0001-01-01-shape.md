A whimsical book about shapes. Playful poems and illustrations will spark children's
imaginations to find shapes everywhere they look!

"Ten shapes are presented in picture and verse. Along with the familiar circle, square, triangle, diamond, rectangle, octagon, and oval are the less frequent star, heart, and crescentâ€¦A fine addition to units on shapes and a perky read-aloud."
