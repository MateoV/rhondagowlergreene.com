_<p class="h2">For the youngest ones…</p>_

PUPPETS AND MUSIC AND SHAPES, OH MY! (PreK-K 30 minutes) Students participate with puppets as I read _Barnyard Song_. Ten large shapes and a guessing game are used with _When a Line Bends…A Shape Begins_. African instruments are used with _Jamboree Day_. Get ready for fun, oh my!

For all grade levels, the presentations are dynamic and fun!

_<p class="h2">The basics:</p>_

<div id="box2"><blockquote><p>

Maximum of 4 presentations a day; max 2 presentations for half-day <br />
(an exception can be made if a 30-minute session for am or pm K needs to be added) <br />
I prefer 50 minutes for a presentation. (for PreK-K, 30 minutes). <br />
When a visit is booked, I send a simple contract and a list of things I'll need the day of the visit. <br />
No deposit is required. <br />
Several weeks before the visit, a book order form is available for your convenience. <br />
I am happy to sign books that students have ordered. <br />
Discretion is used at public schools regarding my religious titles. <br />
If the visit is within driving distance, I charge the standard government mileage rate. <br />
If more than an hour drive from my house, I would appreciate lodging the night before the visit. <br />
If visit is out-of-state, schools can share travel and lodging expenses if I'm booked at multiple schools in the district. <br />
Fees: My fees are very reasonable. Please inquire regarding them.
