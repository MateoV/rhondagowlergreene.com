<p class="h1top">School visits</p>

<div id="attn_visits">
  <span class="attn">Attn</span> <span class="attnstate">Nebraska</span> <span class="attn">teachers and librarians–</span> October 7-9, 2015, I will be speaking in Broken Bow and Grand Island. If you would like to book a school visit around that time, please contact me. I’m also open to visiting other NE cities while there.

<center><p>I love visiting schools! I've been doing author visits across the country for the past 15+ years. My goal?</p></center>

__<center><p>Get students excited about reading and writing!</p></center>__

Since I used to be an elementary teacher, I love interacting with students. And since my master's degree is in Educational Media, my favorite topic to talk about is children's books. (And good writing!)

_<p class="h2">The basics:</p>_

<div id="box2"><p2>

It's always a <i>great</i> visit when students are prepared. A few weeks ahead, get them acquainted with me (website) and my books. <br />
I prefer 50-minute presentations (30 min. for PreK-K). <br />
Discretion is used at public schools regarding my religious titles. <br />
All presentations are <b>very</b> age-appropriate. <br />
Maximum of 4 presentations a day; 2 for half-day (a 30-minute session for am or pm K can possibly be added). <br />
I'm comfortable presenting to all group sizes, small to large (300+). <br />
A simple contract is sent and a list of things needed the day of the visit. <br />
No deposit is required. <br />
A book order form is available. <br />
I'm happy to sign books students have ordered. <br />
Standard government mileage rate is charged when driving. <br />
Lodging is needed the night before if more than an hour drive from my house. <br />
Out-of-state schools can share travel/lodging expenses if I'm booked at more than one school in the district. <br />
Fees: My fees are very reasonable. Please inquire regarding them.
